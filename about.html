While the island has an area of less than 500 square miles, the terrain is varied and includes both sandy and rocky beaches, a small but safe harbor, lush tropical rainforests, and a mountainous interior that includes a small, active volcano. Taniti has an indigenous population of about 20,000. Until a recent increase in tourism, most the Tanitian economy was dominated by fishing or agriculture.</p><p>Being an island in the Pacific, weather conditions can always be a bit unpredictable. Ensure that you keep an eye on the weather to prepare for your day on the island as some locations may not give you a refund due to poor weather conditions.</p><div style="display: flex;"><p>If you have any questions about sight-seeing opportunities, please check out the <a href="https://nerdmouse.gitlab.io/taniti/tourism.html">Tourism</a> page.</p><p>If you have any questions about different dining locations, please check out the <a href="https://nerdmouse.gitlab.io/taniti/restaurants.html">Restaurants</a> page.</p></div><p>If you have any questions about getting to or travelling around the island, please check out the <a href="https://nerdmouse.gitlab.io/taniti/transportation.html">Transportation</a> page.</p><p>For any basic questions, please refer to the FAQ (frequently asked questions) section below.
